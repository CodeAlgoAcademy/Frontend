                  People with disabilities make valuable contributions to the world around us. To create a disability inclusive environment, we must
                  examine the subtle messages we send one another. These messages can cause us to feel connected or disconnected, engaged or
                  disengaged, included or excluded.

                  There is something every child needs to believe. There is something every family member and caregiver needs to know. When they do,
                  all will thrive. There is a powerful way that we, as the adults in childrens’ lives, can nurture this belief and set our children up
                  to learn, grow and flourish. It sounds simple but the effects are huge!

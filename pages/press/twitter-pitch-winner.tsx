               <p>We are thrilled to share that CodeAlgo Academy had a major win at the Visible Hands pitch competition.</p>
               <p className="mt-3">
                  Visible Hands focus on the top of the funnel, the earliest stages of company building, where access to capital, resources, and
                  connections are the biggest barriers for underrepresented founders
               </p>
               <p className="mt-3">
                  After intense competition with some of the amazing startups in the industry, our founder Triumfia Houmbie Fulks was honored to be
                  announced as a winner! The prize money will be used to cover our design costs, enabling us to continue providing innovative
                  solutions for our clients.
               </p>

                  This win is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team members and the support of our valued community. We {"couldn't"}
                  have achieved this without the encouragement and motivation from all of you. We want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who
                  has been a part of this journey with us.
